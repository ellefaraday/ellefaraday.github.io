About two years ago now I was working for the NYC Department of Education as a special education math teacher for middle school students. I had become a teacher by joining Teach For America, an organization created specifically to address the inequity that exists in our public schools. The foundational principle of TFA is that all students, regardless of background, deserve to have access to the highest quality education. 

I still fundamentally believe in that principle. Until we have addressed the inequity of opportunity that exists, simple due to the circumstances of the socioeconomic status, race, gender, sexual orientation, geographical location, etc that someone is born into, we will never truly achieve the American ideal of freedom and justice for all. My choice to leave the DOE came then not from a shift in mission but in answer to the question, "How do I make the biggest contribution I can towards this mission?" 

While trite, it is also inexorably true that technology and programming have come to dominate our lives and will only continue to do so. If the invention of the printing press allowed for the transmission of ideas, and therefore the impact of those ideas, to exponentially increase, then the potential of programming to do the same is nearly unfathomable. 

With this in mind I joined a non-profit called C4Q, which provides access to coding education to diverse adults from underserved backgrounds. My thinking was, if I could contribute to these students' learning to program, then the contributions that they would in turn make through the things that they would build would have an outsized impact on the world. I also believe that there is so much room for innovation in how we teach computer programming. 

Computer programming suffers from a very similar stigma to math, that you need to have an innate aptitude, and that is it beyond the reach of most people. As a special education math teacher, I worked with students with a variety of abilities to make math accessible to them. Computer programming, like math, is a system of thought, and when taught properly anyone can learn that system of thought.

I have loved my time at C4Q, and hope I have positively contributed to our take on programming education, but I continually found myself hitting the wall of my lack of programming knowledge. I feel certain there's more I can do to support our instructors in their pedagogy if only I could better speak their language. It's become obvious to me that to do what I want to do I need to learn to code.

And so, I am finally taking the advice I have been giving our students. I am learning to program. I am completing the online web developer immersive through Flatiron and spending my time outside of my job facing the same struggle and reward as my students. I am so excited to see how I develop as a programmer, and how programming helps me develop as an educator.
