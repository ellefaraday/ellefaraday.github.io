<p>I am a former special education math teacher working as Head of Instructor Development at C4Q. C4Q is a non-profit that provides access to coding education to underrepresented adults in the tech industry. Having directly observed the impact programming education has had on our students' lives, I have determined to take the plunge myself. Outside of tech and education I spend my time with my amazing fianc√©e and our tiny dog, playing roller derby, and creating costumes. </p>
