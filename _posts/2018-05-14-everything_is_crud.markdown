Building a basic CRUD app feels pretty easy and straightforward, especially with liberal use of testing. It's so simple, that at first I was a little underwhelmed with the task. I wanted to build excited things, not just another blog app with some different names. However, as I got into it, and started building ZZZzzz an app to log your sleep, I realized that literally almost everything is CRUD. Twitter: CRUD, Instagram: CRUD, Amazon: CRUD. Certainly all of those sites have other more complicated features built on top, but at the foundation each of them is just CRUD.

As my humble app began to take shape I got more and more ideas for what I could build on top of it. More CRUD capabilities for tracking daily energy levels and caffiene intake, graphs, a dashboard to monitor goals and so much more. While my app is simple now, I can see a whole world of complexity and interesting capabilities just beyond the CRUD I've built.

tl;dr I love CRUD.
